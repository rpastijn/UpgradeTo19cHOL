## Connect to the remote Hands-On Lab client image ##

The HOL lab was written based on the applications available through a Remote Desktop session on the client. For this, you need to have the Remote Desktop application available on your system.

### Windows ###

Please press the Windows/Start button and search for the following application:

![](./images/01-RDPapp.png)

> If you cannot find this application, please start the Microsoft Store on your laptop and install it through the Microsoft store. The application is free to download and install.

After starting the application, the following screen should be visible:

![](./images/02-RDPLogin.png)

Enter the supplied IP address for your remote environment into the `Computer` text field. No other ports or parameters are needed.

Optionally, you can click on the `Show Options` drop-down box to select additional preferences. 

>Experience has shown us that the best `Display` setting is `Full Screen`. After logging in, start a new browser session in the Remote Desktop environment and read the labs in that location
![](./images/03-RDPScreen.png)

After pressing the `Connect` button, the Remote Desktop session will be started. This can take a couple of seconds. 

>You can see some warnings regarding certificates; please accept or ignore them as no certificates have been generated for this temporary environment.
>[](./images/04-RDPTrust.png)

### MacOS ###

> Issues have been reported with RDP clients from other providers than Microsoft. If you encounter issues with your local RDP client, please install the Microsoft RDP client from the Mac store. See link in the Requirements section.
> ![](./images/06-MAC-store.png)

Locate and start the Remote Desktop application. A similar screen to this will be visible:

![](./images/08-MAC-RDPscreen.png)

Create a new entry for your remote environment:

![](./images/09-MAC-Details.png)

Enter the supplied IP address for your remote environment into the `PC Name` text field. No other ports or parameters are needed.

>Experience has shown us that the best way to work is in `Full Screen` mode. After logging in, start a new browser session in the Remote Desktop environment and continue using the labs through the Remote Desktop browser.

>You can see some warnings regarding certificates; please accept or ignore them as no certificates have been generated for this temporary environment.

## Login to Linux system after connection ##

After a succesful connection, you will see another login screen:

![](./images/05-RDPxRDP.png)

Please enter the supplied username and password for this session. After pressing the `Ok` button, you will login to the Linux environment and see the Remote Desktop desktop.

In case of issues, please contact your instructor.

## Optional: Using SSH to connect to the image ##

By default, the SSH ports are enabled and the SSH daemon is running in the image so you can connect your favorite SSH client to the image as well for all non-graphical steps in the labs.

> **The ssh server only accepts public/private key authentication. 
> It is NOT allowed to change the authentication method to accept passwords !**

You are allowed to add your own public key to the `authorized_keys` file in the image. It is out of the scope of this hands-on lab to demonstrate how to do this. 

## Next step: Lab 1 - Install 19c ##

**All labs depend on the 19c installation in lab 1**

- There is no dependency between the labs after lab 1
- Please continue with your hands-on experience by running the steps in Lab 1.
- After finishing Lab 1, continue as instructed to the next Lab or choose an interesting lab
	- If one lab is executing the upgrade, you can start another Lab if you want to
	- Every Lab has its own instances and versions so even the upgrade can run in parallel

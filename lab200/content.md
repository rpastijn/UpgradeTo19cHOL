# Upgrade to 19c using the Autoupgrade tool #

In this lab we will leverage the Autoupgrade tool and upgrade an existing 12.1 CDB with 2 PDBs to 19c in a single command and configuration file..

The development, release, and timing of any features or functionality described for Oracle’s products remains at the sole discretion of Oracle.

## Prerequisites ##

- You have access to the Upgrade to a 19c Hands-on-Lab client image
- A new 19c database has been created in this image
- All databases in the image are running

When in doubt or need to start the databases, please login as **oracle** user and execute the following command:

````
$ <copy>. oraenv</copy>
````
Please enter the SID of the 19c database that you have created in the first lab. In this example, the SID is **`19C`**
````
ORACLE_SID = [oracle] ? <copy>DB19C</copy>
The Oracle base has been set to /u01/app/oracle
````
Now execute the command to start all databases listed in the `/etc/oratab` file:

````
$ <copy>dbstart $ORACLE_HOME</copy>
````

The output should be similar to this:
````
Processing Database instance "DB112": log file /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/dbhome_112/rdbms/log/startup.log
Processing Database instance "DB121C": log file /u01/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/dbhome_121/rdbms/log/startup.log
Processing Database instance "DB122": log file /u01/app/oracle/product/12.2.0/dbhome_122/rdbms/log/startup.log
Processing Database instance "DB18C": log file /u01/app/oracle/product/18.1.0/dbhome_18c/rdbms/log/startup.log
Processing Database instance "DB19C": log file /u01/app/oracle/product/19.3.0/dbhome_19c/rdbms/log/startup.log
````
 
## Prepare the Source database ##
We will use the preinstalled 12.1.0.2 database for this exercise (although we could have used the 11.2 database or any other database).

### Open all PDBS ###

First, we set the environment variables for the 12.1 source environment:

````
$ <copy>. oraenv</copy>
````
````
ORACLE_SID = [oracle] ? <copy>DB121C</copy>
The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
````

We can now log into SQL*Plus as sys user in sysdba mode:

````
$ <copy>sqlplus / as sysdba</copy>
````

The upgrade commands will only upgrade databases (and Pluggable Databases) that are in OPEN mode during the upgrade process. Therefore please check that all PDBs are in OPEN mode before you start the upgrade.

````
SQL> <copy>show pdbs</copy>
````

The following will probably be visible:
````
    CON_ID CON_NAME                       OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED
---------- ------------------------------ ---------- ----------
         2 PDB$SEED                       READ ONLY  NO
         3 DB121C01                       MOUNTED
````

This means we need to open the PDB first. Execute the following commands:

````
SQL> <copy>alter pluggable database all open;</copy>

Pluggable database altered.
````

And check again to see if it worked:

````
SQL> <copy>show pdbs</copy>

    CON_ID CON_NAME                       OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED
---------- ------------------------------ ---------- ----------
         2 PDB$SEED                       READ ONLY  NO
         3 DB121C01                       READ WRITE NO
````

You can now exit SQLPlus and continue on the operating system:

````
SQL> <copy>exit</copy>

Disconnected from Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition Release 12.1.0.2.0 - 64bit Production
With the Partitioning, OLAP, Advanced Analytics and Real Application Testing options
````

## Prepare and run the Autoupgrade tool ##

### Upgrade autoupgrade.jar file ###

For the autoupgrade lab, we need to put the latest version in the new 19c Oracle home. You can download the latest version from MOS. In the client image for this workshop, a new version is already available.

Please execute the following commands:

````
$ <copy>mv /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_193/rdbms/admin/autoupgrade.jar /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_193/rdbms/admin/autoupgrade.jar.org</copy>
````
````
$ <copy>cp /source/autoupgrade.jar /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_193/rdbms/admin/</copy>
````

### Create the Auto Upgrade Config file ###
 
The Auto Upgrade tool is part of the 19c Oracle Home distribution. Previous versions (<= 18.4) will need a separate download and setup from MyOracle Support under note 2485457.1. In this example we will only put one database into the configuration file but you can add as many databases as needed.

First, we will create a directory on the operating system where we can store Autoupgrade related files (and logfiles): 

````
$  <copy>mkdir -p /u01/autoupgrade</copy>
````
````
$ <copy>cd /u01/autoupgrade/</copy>
````

Now we can create a new configuration file for the Auto Upgrade tool. In this example the `vi` tool is used. If you are not familiar with `vi`, feel free to exchange the command with `gedit`:

````
$ <copy>vi DB121C.cfg</copy>
````

Make sure to add the following lines to the new file:
````
<copy>global.autoupg_log_dir=/u01/autoupgrade
upg1.dbname=DB121C
upg1.source_home=/u01/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/dbhome_121
upg1.target_home=/u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_193
upg1.sid=DB121C
upg1.log_dir=/u01/autoupgrade
upg1.upgrade_node=localhost
upg1.target_version=19.3
upg1.run_utlrp=yes
upg1.timezone_upg=yes
upg1.restoration=no</copy>
````

Save the file and close the editor.

Be aware that in the above example, we used the `upg1.restoration=no`. This means that we will **not be able to restore** the database if something goes bad. This setting is only to be used in databases which are in NOARCHIVE mode or databases (like Standard Edition databases) who cannot have a guaranteed restore point (GRP).

In our setup, we use it to speed up the upgrade process (since no archivelog needs to be written) and to save disk space in our limited environment.

### Launch the Auto Upgrade tool pre-check phase ###

We can now launch the Auto upgrade tool. First make sure you have the 19c environment variables setup:

````
$ <copy>. oraenv</copy>
````
````
ORACLE_SID = [ORCL] ? <copy>DB19C</copy>
The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
````

Execute the tool by executing the following command:

````
$ <copy>java -jar $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/autoupgrade.jar -config DB121C.cfg -mode analyze -noconsole</copy>
````

The result should be similar to this:

````
AutoUpgrade tool launched with default options
Processing config file ...
+--------------------------------+
| Starting AutoUpgrade execution |

Jobs pending                   [0]
------------- JOBS FINISHED SUCCESSFULLY -------------
Job 100 for DB121C
````

In the parameter file we specified the location for the logfiles, in this case `/u01/autoupgrade`. After running of the command, the output stated a Job number (100). A new directory has been created in the logfile directory with this name; it contains all of the logfiles for this run. In the prechecks directory, the output of the prechecks are displayed in various formats:

````
$ <copy>cat /u01/autoupgrade/DB121C/100/prechecks/db121c_preupgrade.log</copy>
````

The result should be similar to the following:

````

....
````

In a regular upgrade situation, you can now check whether or not there are blocking issues with regards to your upgrade. The step executed here is basically the same as running the preupgrade.jar manually or through the DBUA.

In this hands-on lab, no changes are required so we can continue with the actual upgrade process.
 
### Execute the full upgrade using Auto Upgrade ###

To continue with the full upgrade of the database(s) in the config file, run the same command but this time with the 'mode=deploy' option. 

````
$ <copy>java -jar $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/autoupgrade.jar -config DB121C.cfg -mode deploy</copy>
````

The output should be similar to the following:

````
Autoupgrade tool launched with default options
+--------------------------------+
| Starting AutoUpgrade execution |
+--------------------------------+
1 databases will be processed
Type 'help' to list console commands

upg>
````
The tool will now upgrade the requested databases in the background. You can request the status by executing the 'lsj' command:

````
upg> <copy>lsj</copy>
````

The following is an example output:

````
+----+-------+---------+---------+-------+--------------+--------+--------+-----------------+
|JOB#|DB NAME|    STAGE|OPERATION| STATUS|    START TIME|END TIME| UPDATED|          MESSAGE|
+----+-------+---------+---------+-------+--------------+--------+--------+-----------------+

+----+-------+---------+---------+-------+--------------+--------+--------+-----------------+ 
````

Using the command prompt, you can do many things to control your upgrade. If there are any failure, you can correct the failures and restart the job or perhaps restore the environment to its original state. On the operating system you can check the running of the upgrade as well. 

To get a more detailed status of the job, you can use the `status` command with the job number of your upgrade. Example:

````
upg> <copy>status -job 101</copy>

````

The actual upgrade will be done using the regular tools for upgrading databases. You can see this in the operating system once the `lsj` command indicates that the actual upgrade has started:

````
upg> <copy>lsj</copy>
````

If you see that the actual database upgrade is running like this:

````
upg> lsj

+----+-------+---------+---------+-------+--------------+--------+--------+-------+
````

You can open a second terminal window (do not close the running autoupgrade tool) that the regular tools are being used by the autoupgrade tool for the upgrade:


````
$ <copy>ps -ef | grep perl</copy>
````

The output will be similar tot the following:

````
oracle   17211 11951  0 10:13 pts/4    00:00:01 /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_193/perl/bin/perl /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_193/rdbms/admin/catctl.pl -A -l /u01/autoupgrade/100/dbupgrade -i 20190321101158db112 -d /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_193/rdbms/admin catupgrd.sql
````

Please, again, note that the perl command will only give you a result if the autoupgrade tool is actually running the perl scripts of course.

The logfiles in the `/u01/autoupgrade/DB121C/[job#]` directory show you the progress as well for example:

````
$ <copy>cd /u01/autoupgrade/DB121C/101</copy>
````
````
$ <copy>tail -f autoupgrade_</copy>(Press TAB).log

Your filename should be like autoupgrade_<date>.log
````

The output will be similar to the following:

````

**The whole upgrade using the options chosen in this lab takes about 120 minutes**

You can continue with other labs or let the instructor know you are waiting for the upgrade to finish.

After a while, you will see that the upgrade has finished:

````
+--------------------------------+
| Starting AutoUpgrade execution |
+--------------------------------+
1 databases will be processed

Job 101 for DB121C FINISHED
````

You database is now upgraded to 19c (with all PDBs as well).

## Check target database ##

To check your target database you can execute the following:

````
$ <copy>. oraenv</copy>
````
````
ORACLE_SID = [DB19C] ? <copy>DB121C</copy>
The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
````
````
$ <copy>sqlplus / as sysdba</copy>
````
Although we just set the environment variables for the SID DB121C, the SQL*Plus output already shows that the Autoupgrade tool has changed the `\etc\oratab` file and updated the home for the DB121C database (which is now the 19c database):

````
SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Fri Mar 22 16:38:53 2019

````

Check the version of the database by querying the `v$instance` view:

````
SQL> <copy>select version from v$instance;</copy>
````

The outputwill be similar to this:

````
